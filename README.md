# number_detection
 My first machine learning project uses the MNIST dataset to develop a model for digit recognition. Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, this project focuses on accurately identifying handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. It serves as a foundation for understanding neural networks and basic image classification techniques.
